Shpotify is a ncurses client for Spotify.

Currently it runs only on GNU/Linux.

By using this program you accept the Spotify EULA, that you can find
here:

------------------------ BUILD INSTRUCTION -----------------------------

You need libspotify to build the program, you can download it here:

https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#download

Be sure that pkg-config can find it, you may need to modify the prefix
value in the /lib/pkgconfig/libspotify.pc in order to achieve it.

Also, you need these libraries installed, otherwise the configure
script will fail:

- libasound
- libjpeg
- libncurses

The code stinks!  It is just a few days hack and wasn't supposed to be
used or made public.  Feel free to improve it.
